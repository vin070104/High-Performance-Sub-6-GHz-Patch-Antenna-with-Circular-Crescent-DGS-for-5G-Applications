# High-Performance-Sub-6-GHz-Patch-Antenna-with-Circular-Crescent-DGS-for-5G-Applications
This project focuses on designing a compact and efficient microstrip patch antenna for 3.5 GHz Sub-6 GHz wireless communication. The antenna is built on an FR4 substrate and is optimized for applications such as 5G, IoT devices and UAV communication systems, where size, efficiency and stable operation are important.

The initial version of the antenna used a standard rectangular patch without any modifications to the ground plane. Although it resonated at the intended frequency, it produced a weak return loss of around –7.25 dB at 3.5 GHz. This indicated poor impedance matching and higher reflected power, making the antenna unsuitable for practical high-frequency communication.

To address this, a circular-crescent Defected Ground Structure (DGS) was introduced beneath the patch. The DGS alters the surface current flow on the ground plane, suppresses unwanted modes and enhances the electromagnetic coupling between the patch and the ground. This modification significantly improved the antenna’s performance. The return loss increased to –21.2 dB at 3.5 GHz and the antenna gained an additional strong resonance at 3.28 GHz with an excellent –35.29 dB. The improved VSWR confirmed better matching with the feed line, and the overall radiation behavior also became more stable.

The project includes the full HFSS simulation setup: the antenna geometry, DGS model, parametric analysis of patch and feed dimensions, surface current distributions, S11 plots, VSWR, gain evaluation and radiation patterns. The final gain reached 4.06 dB, giving the antenna reliable radiation efficiency while keeping the structure compact at 19.6 × 27.2 mm.

In summary, the work demonstrates how a simple geometric modification to the ground plane can transform a basic patch antenna into a high-performance Sub-6 GHz radiating element. The final design is small, efficient and suitable for modern wireless communication systems that require dependable performance within restricted physical dimensions.
